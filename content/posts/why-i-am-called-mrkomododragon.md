Consistently throughout the internet, I have become to be known as MrKomodoDragon. Why, you might ask? Well, that's what this blog post is for! This will have a short history as well as why I chose Komodo Dragons as the thing I use for my username.

## Side Rant
The most obvious reasons that I am named MrKomodoDragon is that Komodo Dragons are the coolest animals to walk this Earth. This is for several reasons: 
1. They are a reptile, and reptiles are cool.
2. They are one of the largest lizards to walk the Earth currently.
3. They are one of the coolest hunters to walk the Earth.

## Roblox
The usage of Komodo Dragon as a username was in Roblox, where I was called `Darthkomododragon1` because I liked Komodo Dragons and Star Wras then, espcially Darth Vader.
